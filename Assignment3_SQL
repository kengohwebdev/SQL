--6.      How do you make sure two tables have the same data?

Users can use join to combine results into one or more tables either by comparing columns or row-by-row using union, join or subquery

1)  UNION allows users to compare data from two similar tables or data sets.
    UNION ALL also handles the null values so it quickly checking what are the data missing or changed in either table.

2)  Inner JOIN only return a resulting row if the join condition matches in both tables.

3)  Users can also use nested queries on WHERE the data values are equal.
