Conceptual Questions


What does CRUD stand for?
CRUD stands for CREATE, READ, UPDATE and DELETE so the users can create the date, retrieve the data, update the data and delete the data.

What are the System Databases?
Database is a collection of data. There are 5 System databases are Master, Model, Tempdb,Mssql,Msdb.
1) The master databse is composed of system tables that keep track of the server installation as a whole and 
   all other daabases that are subsequently created. The master databse is critical to the system as it keeps 
   a current backup files.
2) Model databse is a template database. New database will inherit from previous model template or with new 
   changes to objects or new template size you create.
3) Tempdb is a place to store database objects that are temporary such as temporary tables.
4) Mssql system restore is a hidden database. Precoded functions come from the system function such as system 
   stored procedures and functions.
5) Msdb is used by the SQL server agent service for backup and maintenance purposes.


What is OLAP and OLTP?
OLTP stands for online transaction process, OLTP captures,stores, and processess data from transanction in real time. OLTP has file size around 1 tb and uses SQL server and reviews.
OLAP stands for online analytical process. OLPA uses complex queries to analyze aggregated historical data from OLTP system. OLAP can handle up to 1000 tb and uses datalake/warehouse.
Using relation database, OLAP can have many more OLTP and Extract Transform Load, ETL.
For example, the relation database can chop off the data into objects and store it as json format in OLAP or using new sequal to store into a format in OLTP. 


What is the difference between DDL vs. DML?
Data Definition Language (DDL) Statement allows user to create in the database such as using 
CREATE onject_name; 
ALTER object_name;
DROP object_name;
Data Manipulation Language (DML) Statement allow user to query and modify the data such as using
SELECT
INSERT
UPDATE
DELETE



What does the “Like” keyword do?
LIKE operatpr create a search expression and it works with wildcards to search for macthing characters. LIKE opertor is used in a WHERE clause to search for a specified pattern in a column.


List the wildcards available for the Like Operator.

1. The percent sign (%) represents zero, one, or multiple characters.
2. The underscore sign(_) represents one, single character.
3. The ^operator works like a not operator in the bracket.
For example :
SELECT TOP (1) ContactName,PostalCode
FROM Customers
WHERE PostalCOde Like '1[_0_^0-3]%'
--Note: ^operator works like a not operator in the bracket wildcard
 ContactName   PostalCode

What's the difference between left join and inner join?
LEFT JOIN returns all the records from the left table, even if there are no matches in the right table. INNER JOIN returns the records that have matching values in both tables.

Where Name like 'S%'



Write a query that retrieves the columns Name and ListPrice from the Production.Product table. Your result set should look something like the following. Order the result set
by the Name column. The products name should start with either 'A' or 'S'

FROM   Production.Product
WHERE Name LIKE '[A,S]%'
ORDER BY Name ASC;

Write a query that retrieves the unique combination of columns ProductSubcategoryID and Color from the Production.Product table. We do not want any rows that are NULL.in any of
the two columns in the result. (Hint: Use IsNull)


SELECT DISTINCT IsNull(ProductSubcategoryID , '') AS ProductSubcategoryID, color 
FROM   Production.Product
WHERE color is not null;
